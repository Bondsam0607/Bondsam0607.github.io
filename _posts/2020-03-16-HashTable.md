## Why do we need hash table?

for faster searching within O(1)

## two parts

- Hash function
	**What is a good hash func?**
	- Easy to compute
	- Uniform distribution
	- Less collision
- Hash table

## Collision Resolustion Techniques

- Seperate chaining
- Linear probing
- Quadratic probing
- Double hashing

## Notes

- If an array is sorted or partially sorted, using binary search will help.
- Sorting an array may simplify the problem.
- For questions where summation or multiplication of a subarray is involved, pre-computation using hashing or a prefix/suffix sum/product might be useful.
- If the interviewer askes for O(1) space, maybe use the array itself as a hash table.

## some situations to care

- Are there duplicate values in the array?
- While using an index to iterate the array, be careful not to go out of the bound.
- Be mindful about slicing or concatenating arrays in your code. Each of them will cost O(n) time.
- Sometimes traverse the array from right to left.
- Sliding Window Technique is useful to lots of subarray questions.
- When given two arrays to process, use two indices to traverse/compare.
